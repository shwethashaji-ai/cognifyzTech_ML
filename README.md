# 🚀 CognifyzTech - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Objective
Build a **machine learning model** to predict the **aggregate rating** of a restaurant based on other features.

## 🛠 Steps
1️⃣ **Preprocess the dataset** by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.  
2️⃣ **Select a regression algorithm** (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression) and train it on the training data.  
3️⃣ **Evaluate the model's performance** using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-Squared) on the testing data.  
4️⃣ **Interpret the model's results** and analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.  

## ✨ Features
✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Machine Learning model training  
✅ Model evaluation and interpretation  

## 🔧 Installation
Follow these steps to run the notebook on your local machine:

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shwethashaji-ai/cognifyzTech_ML/blob/main/predict_restaurant_ratings.ipynb
   cd cognifyzTech
   ```
2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3️⃣ Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook cognifyzTech.ipynb
   ```

## 📦 Dependencies
Make sure you have these Python libraries installed:
- 📊 pandas
- 🔢 numpy
- 📈 matplotlib
- 📉 seaborn
- 🤖 scikit-learn
- 📝 jupyter

Install them using:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## 🎯 Usage
1️⃣ Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially.  
2️⃣ Train and evaluate the machine learning model.  
3️⃣ Interpret results and analyze feature importance.
