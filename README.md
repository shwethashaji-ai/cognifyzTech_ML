## 📂 Tasks

### 🔍 Task 1: Predicting Restaurant Ratings
**🎯 Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict restaurant ratings based on various features.

**🛠️ Steps:**
✅ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, splitting datasets)
✅ Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression)
✅ Evaluate performance (Mean Squared Error, R-Squared, etc.)
✅ Analyze key influencing factors for restaurant ratings

---

### 🍽️ Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System
**🎯 Objective:** Build a recommendation system based on user preferences.

**🛠️ Steps:**
✅ Preprocess data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
✅ Define recommendation criteria (cuisine preference, price range, etc.)
✅ Implement a content-based filtering system
✅ Test recommendations using sample user inputs

---

### 🍕 Task 3: Cuisine Classification Model
**🎯 Objective:** Use machine learning to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

**🛠️ Steps:**
✅ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
✅ Split the dataset into training and testing sets
✅ Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
✅ Evaluate model accuracy using metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
✅ Identify biases and challenges in classification

---

### 🌍 Task 4: Geographical Analysis of Restaurants
**🎯 Objective:** Perform a spatial analysis of restaurant locations.

**🛠️ Steps:**
✅ Visualize restaurant locations using latitude & longitude data
✅ Group restaurants by city/locality & analyze distribution
✅ Compute statistics (average ratings, cuisine diversity, price range)
✅ Identify trends and insights from the data
